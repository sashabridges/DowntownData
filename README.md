# DowntownData
A group project by Charlie Ortman, Steve Ricard, Tad Tatsuya Murao, and Sasha Bridges.

This project will utilize HTML, Python, Bootstrap, D3, MySQL, Flask, FontAwesome, and FrappeChartsJS.

The Index page provides quick links to four major pages: Income Data, the Violent Crime Report, the Property Crime Report, and a comparison between Income VS Crime.

The Income Data shows a line chart of the income changes from 2014 through 2018.

The Violent Crime Report shows data from 2017 in a bar chart format and in a table format.

The Property Crime Report shows data from 2017 in a bar chart format and in a table format.

Income Vs Crime provides a mixed line-bar graph that shows the relationship between income and several different types of crimes.

Using the Graphs dropdown you can access the four previously mentioned pages, but you can also view Kansas City Crimes in 2017.

Kansas City Crimes shows two different pie charts and a table indicating how many crimes happened in 2017.

Resources provides all the KCPD DataSets, Income Data, and the IncomeAPI.
